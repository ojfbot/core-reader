## Context

Frame OS currently surfaces four domain applications — cv-builder, blogengine, tripplanner, and purefoy — as Module Federation remotes in the shell. All four serve end-user domains. There is no application that exposes the framework's own operational metadata: the 30 Claude commands, 9+ ADRs, OKRs, and domain-knowledge docs that define how Frame OS itself is built and evolved.

Today, a developer working inside Frame OS must leave the Frame OS experience (drop to a terminal, open a file editor, read raw markdown) to browse commands, check ADR status, or update the roadmap. This breaks the "AI-native application OS" story: the system that manages other apps should itself be manageable through the same UI paradigm it provides.

CoreReader addresses this by introducing a fifth sub-app that reads the `core` repo's own filesystem and presents it as a structured, queryable, eventually-mutable dashboard — appearing in the shell's app switcher alongside the other four apps.

---

## Decision

CoreReader is a new sibling repo (`core-reader`) that follows the established Frame OS sub-app architecture:

- **Dual-mode** (ADR-0009): standalone preview on `:3015`, embedded MF remote on `:3016`
- **Module Federation remote** consumed by the shell host at `:4000` — no iframes (ADR-0001)
- **Frame-agent routing** for the embedded chat agent — no direct Anthropic calls in CoreReader packages (ADR-0002)
- **GET /api/tools** capability manifest (ADR-0007)
- **Carbon Design System** for all UI components (ADR-0005)

### Data access

CoreReader API reads the `core` repo filesystem via a `CORE_REPO_PATH` environment variable. This decouples the two repos while giving the API full read access to commands, ADRs, OKRs, and docs.

```
CORE_REPO_PATH=/path/to/ojfbot/core
```

No separate database. All persistence is the `core` repo filesystem.

**Phase 3 mutation model — git worktree staging:**
Mutations do not write directly to the working tree. The API creates a temporary `git worktree` (via `git worktree add`) inside the `CORE_REPO_PATH` repo, applies changes there, and returns a unified diff to the UI for review. The user explicitly commits from the CoreReader UI (or CLI). This staging layer is designed to be extended: future dev-mode configuration will support branch selection, commit message templates, and auto-push to remote without changing the mutation API surface.

### Port assignment

| Mode       | Port | Consumer            |
|------------|------|---------------------|
| Standalone | 3015 | Developer / QA      |
| Embedded   | 3016 | Shell MF host :4000 |

3015/3016 follows the `X0 standalone / X1 embedded` pattern from ADR-0009, extended to the next available slot after tripplanner (:3010/:3011).

### API surface

```

```

### Chat agent routing

The CoreReader chat panel connects to `frame-agent` POST `/api/chat` (same as shell), passing the active tab context in the conversation history. Frame-agent registers a `CoreReaderDomainAgent` that calls back to CoreReader's REST API as its tool layer. This maintains the single-gateway constraint (ADR-0002) without requiring CoreReader to speak to Claude directly.

### Implementation phases

| Phase | Scope | Unblocks |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Scaffold, read-only Commands + ADRs + Roadmap, Shell MF integration | Developer tool immediately usable |
| 2 | OKRs, Docs tabs; cross-entity links | Full read coverage |
| 3 | File write-back for all entities; chokidar + WebSocket live sync | Mutations from UI |
| 4 | LangGraph chat agent via frame-agent; global Cmd+K search | NL queries and mutations |
| 5 | Backlinks panel, drag-and-drop kanban, markdown editor, a11y audit | Polish |

### UX specification

Derived from cross-app pattern analysis. Full research brief: `domain-knowledge/corereader-ux-research.md`.

**Dominant UI pattern:** Developer portal + TripPlanner's persistent chat overlay.
CoreReader is not a workflow app (unlike blogengine) and not a single-domain editor (unlike cv-builder). Users browse a corpus and ask questions about it. The tripplanner "lens views + CondensedChat persists across all views" model maps directly.

**Phase 1 tab structure — three tabs:**

| Tab | Pattern source | Key components |
|-----|---------------|----------------|
| Commands | BlogEngine Library tab | Filter bar (Tier/Phase/Search) + expandable CommandCard + markdown render |
| ADRs | TripPlanner lens views | Lens switcher (All / By Status / By Repo) + expandable ADRCard + cross-linked tags |
| Roadmap | TripPlanner lens views | Phase table from frame-os-context.md; Carbon `ProgressIndicator` (stepped); status `Tag` per phase |

Cross-links: `Commands affected` tag pills in an ADR card are clickable — they navigate to the Commands tab filtered to that command. Roadmap phase status links to the relevant ADRs where they exist.

**CondensedChat — staged but visible in Phase 1:**

A disabled chat footer is present from Phase 1 with the label "Ask about the codebase — available in Phase 4." The assistant's entry point is on-screen before it's live (TBCoNY: assistant-centric architecture means the AI is a visible organizing primitive, not a feature added later).

If wiring `CoreReaderDomainAgent` read-only in Phase 1 is feasible (single tool: `get_document`, no mutations), it should be pulled forward. A read-only chat satisfies the TBCoNY "at least one orchestration flow" requirement within Phase 1 alone.

**Phase 3 mutation confirmation (Dia security principle):**

Every mutation surfaces a diff panel with the label "Here's what I'm about to do:" before any write occurs. No silent writes. The git worktree staging model makes this natural — the diff is the staging diff, shown verbatim. User must click Commit to finalize.

**Carbon components:**

| Use | Component |
|-----|-----------|
| Tab navigation | `ContentSwitcher` |
| Lens view switcher (ADRs) | `ContentSwitcher` (nested) |
| Status / tier / phase labels | `Tag` |
| Command / ADR list | expandable card pattern (custom over `StructuredList`) |
| Docs file tree (Phase 2) | `TreeView` |
| Roadmap phases (Phase 1) | `ProgressIndicator` (stepped) |
| Mutation diff (Phase 3) | `CodeSnippet` (multi-line, read-only) |
| Chat input | `TextInput` + `Button` (same as ShellHeader pattern) |
| Markdown render | `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` |

## Consequences

### Gains

- Frame OS is self-describing — operators manage the framework from inside the framework
- ADR, OKR, and command workflows gain a visual layer on top of the existing `/adr`, `/techdebt` CLI commands
- Demonstrates the "application OS" concept with a domain that every hiring-panel viewer immediately understands (it's a tool for the tool)
- Phase 1 provides immediate value: browsing 30 commands and 10+ ADRs without opening a file editor

### Costs

- New repo to maintain; adds to the 7-repo cluster
- `CORE_REPO_PATH` creates a runtime coupling between `core-reader` and the `core` filesystem that doesn't exist for other sub-apps
- Phase 3 mutations introduce file write-back — requires careful API validation to prevent accidental data loss or malformed markdown
- frame-agent must register a `CoreReaderDomainAgent` — extends the routing layer that is already a refactor candidate (Phase 2 roadmap)

### Neutral

- Filesystem-backed persistence (no DB) is consistent with core's existing ADR/OKR storage
- Port 3015/3016 does not conflict with any existing service
- CoreReader has no end-user content — it is developer/operator tooling embedded in a portfolio product

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|-------------|--------------|
| CoreReader as packages inside the `core` monorepo | Mixes workflow framework packages with a demo sub-app; complicates installs into sibling repos; breaks the clean boundary between `core` (tooling) and sub-apps (demo products) |
| Read-only forever (no mutation phases) | Limits the demo value — a dashboard you can only read is less impressive than one you can mutate from; /adr and /techdebt already prove the write-back pattern works |
| Direct Anthropic calls in agent-graph | Violates ADR-0002; adds a second API key context outside frame-agent's single-gateway contract |
| SQLite database for parsed entities | Adds infra complexity with no benefit — the `core` filesystem IS the source of truth; caching can be in-memory if needed |
| iframe instead of Module Federation | Violates ADR-0001 |

## Tech Debt

**TD-001 — stack consistency check in planning phase (process debt)**
The original planning doc specified Webpack 5 for CoreReader's `browser-app`, deviating from every other Frame OS sub-app (all use Vite + `VITE_EMBED_MODE`). This slipped through initial ADR drafting and was caught during code review. Corrected to Vite before merge.

Root cause: planning docs were generated against the spec without cross-checking the established stack in `domain-knowledge/shared-stack.md` and existing sub-app configs. Mitigation: `/spec-review` should explicitly check `bundler` and `build tool` fields against the canonical stack before any scaffold work begins.

## Resolved Decisions

**1. frame-agent registration:** CoreReader registers as a full domain in frame-agent — a `CoreReaderDomainAgent` sits alongside `CvBuilderDomainAgent`, `BlogEngineDomainAgent`, etc. The MetaOrchestrator routes NL intent to it via the same mechanism as other domains. This keeps routing consistent and discoverable.

**2. Mutation staging:** Phase 3 mutations stage changes in a **local git working tree** rather than writing directly to disk. The API creates a temporary working tree via `git worktree add`, applies mutations there, and returns a diff for review before the user commits. This is intentionally extensible — the staging layer will later support additional dev-mode configuration (branch selection, commit message templates, auto-push to remote). Direct write is deferred; staging is the foundation.

**3. Phase priority:** CoreReader is **fast-tracked** — it ships before the remaining Phase 1 work (TripPlanner MF, cv-builder MF). The rationale: CoreReader done well gives quick browser access to roadmap, ADRs, and commands as a single point of contact, accelerating iteration on everything else. All four — CoreReader Phase 1, TripPlanner MF, cv-builder MF, and BlogEngine GET /api/tools fix — then ship together as a coherent milestone.
